A very simple Python script for finding anagrams. The script looks for a file named words_alpha.txt in the same folder, and while it is intended to be one from [here](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/), you can use whatever file you like, provided each word is on a new line. To use, type `python anagram-finder.py %word`, where %word is the word you're trying to find anagrams of.
